<h2>What is NLP(Natural Language Processing?)</h2>

The Natural Language Processing is application of computational techniques to the analysis and synthesis of natural language and speech.

<li>
Summarize blocks of text using Summarizer to extract the most important and central ideas while ignoring irrelevant</li> information. 
<li>Create a chat bot using Parsey McParseface, a language parsing deep learning model made by Google that uses Point-of-Speech tagging.</li>
<li>Automatically generate keyword tags from content using AutoTag, which leverages LDA, a technique that discovers topics contained within a body of text.</li>
<li>Identify the type of entity extracted, such as it being a person, place, or organization using Named Entity Recognition.</li>
<li>Use Sentiment Analysis to identify the sentiment of a string of text, from very negative to neutral to very positive.</li>
<li>Reduce words to their root, or stem, using PorterStemmer, or break up text into tokens using Tokenizer.
</li>

<h1>Common NLP tasks in software programs today include:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging and parsing.</li>
<li>Deep analytics.</li>
<li>Named entity extraction.</li>
<li>Co-reference resolution.</li>
</ul>
